This project breaks the creation of an Authors view down into several small steps.
To run each step separately, edit index.js to import the desired version of Authors_v?.jsx.

* Authors_v1.jsx:  Just shows placeholders for the major components.
* Authors_v2.jsx:  Adds state and displays the Authors List
* Authors_v3.jsx:  Adds the Author form, and configures it to handle the *creation* of authors.
* Authors_v4.jsx:  Connects the Edit button to populate the form and process an update.
* Authors_v5.jsx:  Connect the cancel and delete buttons.
